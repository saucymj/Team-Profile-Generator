# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

I built this project so that a team of software developers that included a manager position, engineers, and even interns would be able to create a profile with everyone all on one page. They will be able to enter the manager's name, email, id, and office number. They will also be able to enter the engineer's and intern's name, email, id, github, and even the intern's school name. I learned how to create a html page from just using backend technology.

## Installation

To run my program you would have to install npm first to get all of the dependencies and then use node to start the process of creating the team profiles.
